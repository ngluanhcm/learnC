Exercise 12476
Write a program last that prints the last n lines of its text input. By default n should be 5, but your
program should allow an optional argument so that
last -n
prints out the last n lines, where n is any integer. Your program should make the best use of available
storage. (Input of text could be by reading a file specified from the command or reading a file from
standard input)
